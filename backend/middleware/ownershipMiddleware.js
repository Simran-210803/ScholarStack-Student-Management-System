/*
  Ownership Middleware (Planned Feature)

  Purpose:
  This middleware is intended to verify whether the
  authenticated user owns the requested resource
  (such as profile data, enrollments, or courses).

  Current Status:
  Not implemented in the current version because
  role-based access control (RBAC) sufficiently
  restricts access for the project scope.

  Future Use:
  Will be implemented to add resource-level security
  where users can only modify or view their own data.
